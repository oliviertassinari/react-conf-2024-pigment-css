            <li>Hi everyone! I'm so excited to be here.</li>
            <li>
              I'm Olivier and I'm going to talk about your favorite topic, or maybe not: CSS-in-JS.
            </li>
            <li>
              By the end of this presentation, I would like you to better understand how React
              Server Components are shaking this space, the challenges with today's generation of
              libraries, and the key properties I think you should look out for a great styling
              solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, React Server Components might shake the space, but there is hope. I'm also going
              to introduce Pigment CSS, which is part of a next generation movement for CSS-in-JS
              libraries.

              According to the last State of CSS survey, over 60% of the frontend community uses one
              of these two.

              And again, from the same State of CSS survey, you can see a clear decline of interest
              in styled-components and Emotion

              I can't provide a definitive answer, but at MUI, we are facing the same challenges.

              For those that don't know me, I co-created Material UI a long time ago. I'm now
              running MUI as its CEO.

            <li>
              At MUI, we fund the development of a few open-source projects:
              <br />
              - Material UI, a popular UI library that implements Google's Material Design
              <br />
              - Base UI, a headless, "unstyled" UI component library
              <br />
              - MUI X, a set of advanced React components, like Data Grids, Charts, and so on
              <br />
              - Toolpad, a set of components to quickly build internal tools
              <br />
            </li>
            <li>
              The common denominator between them is that all these projects rely on Emotion in one
              way or another.
            </li>
            <li>And we are facing two main challenges:</li>
